Steps to run on local machine -
1. Download model weights for Llama-2 (any variant which you prefer)
2. Change the path of the model to the one where the downloaded model weights are kept.
3. Install the required libraries from requirements.txt
4. Run the streamlit app by using command prompt.

Future Work - 
* Containerize & deploy this app
* Add more functionality to make a multi purpose app
